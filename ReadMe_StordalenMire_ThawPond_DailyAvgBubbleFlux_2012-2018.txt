Column Headings:
Date 			-- MM/DD/YYYY, local time
Field_ID 		-- Original Pond identifiers, used in field notes

DailyAvgBubbleFlux	-- Calculated Daily Average CH4 bubble flux projected across the corresponding sampling dates (mg CH4 m-2 d-1)

NOTE: Reference to specific ponds in this ReadMe file use the Burkeetal(2019)_ID identifier.

Detailed Description:

Date -- Dates correspond to the days at which daily average flux was calculated.  

Pond -- Eight ponds were sampled for ebullitive flux between 2012 and 2015 using a floating funnels system similar to that of Wik et al. 2013
	A - sampled 2013, 2015 
		-- Pond A water table in 2014 was too low to deploy bubble traps
	B - sampled 2013, 2014, 2015
		-- Pond B water table drew down in 2014 by mid- July so the bubble traps were no longer sampled after 7/20/14
	C - sampled 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015
	D - sampled 2013, 2014, 2015
	E - sampled 2013, 2014, 2015
	F - sampled 2013, 2014, 2015
	G - sampled 2012, 2013
		-- Pond G sampling halted after 2013 field season due to disturbance caused while sampling
	H - sampled 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015
	
	Initial deployment date varies between sampling seasons. 

GPS Locations (Lat,Long) of each pond -- the following GPS coordinates are of a point on the shore of each pond, no more than 3 meters from the pond itself.

DailyAvgBubbleFlux - Daily Average Pond Flux (mg CH4 m-2 d-1)
	Two floating bubble traps were deployed in each pond, except for Pond F which had four bubble traps. Bubble traps were visited daily to weekly. Daily Avg. Bubble flux was calculated using the same method as Wik et al. (2013). J. Geo. Res. Biogeosciences. Daily CH4 bubble flux was then estimated based on the assumption of constant release of CH4 during trap deployment. Flux values are accurate up to three significant figures.
